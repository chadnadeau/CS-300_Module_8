The problem that needed to be solved was a way for advisors to efficiently and effectively sort through courses and determine the course Id, course name, and the prerequisites that were needed for the specified course.

> How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

Approaching this problem was difficult because there are a few data structures that could have been used. Choosing the correct data structure was the hardest challenge, but overall I believe I made the right decision.

> How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

When I encountered road blocks with these projects, I always reverted back to the roots of ZyBooks to see if there was something simple that I overlooked. From there I would research on stack overflow to see if anyone else had the same problem, as well as a solution.

> How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

My work on this project was defined by taking my time and understanding what I was writing. Making sure that everything talked harmoniously, was really beneficial to my learning.

> How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

Keeping track of functions, classes, and structs really proved to be effective. Writing each piece in order to make sure it coincided correctly helped with understanding the process better.
